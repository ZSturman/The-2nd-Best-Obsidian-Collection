# The-2nd-Best-Obsidian-Collection

This repo is a growing collection of Obsidian resources designed to enhance how you interact with your notes and manage your information. 

## Current Features

### Dashboard

The `Dashboard` feature is a dynamic way to visualize your Obsidian folders and notes, using a layout inspired by NextJS routing. It helps you turn your Obsidian vault into a navigable dashboard, organizing content through a flexible folder system.

- **How It Works**: The dashboard automatically organizes files into rows and columns based on your folder structure, making it easy to visualize and access your notes directly from the Obsidian homepage.

- **Setup**: Simply paste the provided CSS and JavaScript files into your Obsidian settings to get started.

### QueueCards

The `QueueCards` feature helps you stay organized by creating a queue of notes to work through. You can skip items if you're not ready to deal with them yet, and each time you do, the skip counter goes up. This count also influences the color of the queued items, so you can see at a glance which items you've been avoiding.

- **Requirements**: For this to work, your notes need to have a `to` field in the frontmatter or metadata. This field can either be a string or an array of strings.

- **Setup**: Copy and paste the provided JavaScript and CSS files into your vault, and configure Templater to use the script.
